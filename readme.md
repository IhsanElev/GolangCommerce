# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Architecture Overview

This repository follows a structured organization to maintain clarity and separation of concerns. Below are the main folders and their purposes:

- **cmd**: Contains command-line interfaces (CLI) or entry points for the application. Each subfolder may represent a different application or service.

- **external**: Houses external dependencies or third-party libraries used in the project. This folder typically includes code that is not part of the application's core functionality but is necessary for its operation.

- **internal**: Contains internal packages or modules that form the core functionality of the application. This folder structure is often organized based on domain-driven design (DDD) principles, with subfolders representing different domains or modules within the application.

- **utility**: Holds utility functions, helper classes, or shared components that are used across different parts of the application. These utilities serve to enhance code reusability and maintainability.

- **infra**: Includes infrastructure-related code, such as database configurations, API clients, or external service integrations. This folder encapsulates code responsible for interacting with external systems or managing infrastructure resources.


In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), the architectural components outlined below are crucial for structuring and organizing the application layer(app folder) to effectively represent and manage the business domain:

- **Entity**: Represents domain objects with unique identity and state, enforcing business rules and invariants.
- **Handler**: Responsible for handling incoming requests and coordinating actions within the application.
- **Repository**: Provides an abstraction layer for accessing and managing domain objects, facilitating separation of concerns and testing.
- **Request**: Represents incoming messages or commands, carrying necessary information for processing.
- **Service**: Encapsulates domain-specific business logic, promoting reusability and modularity.
- **Base**: Router.
These components work collaboratively to model and implement the business domain effectively, leading to a software architecture that is expressive, understandable, and adaptable.
